  <figure title="Zooming">
    <figcaption><p>This was an idea I had for handling zooming in/out on nodes in the Collusion graph. More of a cool visual concept than a particularly useful one at this point, but it might be a start for dealing with multiple view levels and large amounts of data.<p></figcaption>
