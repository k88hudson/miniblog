Summary: What makes a good first-run experience? Information, immersion, and the separation of individual critical activities

  <h2>The right information, in the right context</h2>
  <p>When new users download Pinterest, they expect to look at pretty pictures. If they are buying a long-form magazine subscription, they expect to read.</p>
  <p>Marco Arment's new <a href="http://www.the-magazine.org">The Magazine</a> for iPhone and iPad is a compelling example of using the first-run experience to deliver critical information while simultaneously teaching users about the interface.</p>
  <figure title="The Magazine - Forward">
    <figcaption>
      <p>This is what you get when you download the app. It's a personally written persuasive essay from the author about what his magazine provides that other tech magazines don't (clarity, sparsity, editoral quality).</p>
      <p>Arment assumes that users more likely want to hear about this than features, visual design, or even the exact details of how and when content will be delivered. I think he's right.</p>

  <figure title="The Magazine - Annotations">
    <figcaption><p>But the other reason this forward works as a first-run experience is that it is <em>written in the style and tone of the content he intends to deliver</em>, .i.e it is working proof of itself. His goal is to offer thoughtful editorials about tech&mdash;this is a thoughtful editorial about tech. It uses the real interface.</p>
    <p>In a sense, the forward is actually a tutorial about how to read <em>The Magazine</em>. Like a really good, invisible one.</p>

  <h2 id="#twitter">Twitter</h2>
  <p>Unlike <em>the Magazine</em> , Twitter has a obvious high-level premise&mdash;say something in 140 characters or less, connect with friends&mdash;but an interface and language that is unfamiliar to the uninitiated.(<b>#</b>, <b>@</b>, <b>tweet</b>, <b>reply</b>, <img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/29163874/Screenshots/7b.png">)</p>
  <p>The first-time tutorial does a good job at isolating essential activities and incorporating real content/people to follow. And while it feels more like a tutorial than <em>the Magazine</em>, it's definitely immersive.</p>

  <figure title="Twitter get started">
    <figcaption>
      <p>Twitter uses a modified form of its regular interface that replaces components with information about how to use the app.</p>

  <figure title="Get started by following 5 people">
    <figcaption>
      <p>It leads users through a step-by-step interactive tutorial, asking them to focus on a single activity in each step.</p>
      <p>These steps teach twitter users to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>follow other users</li>
        <li>add a profile pic</li>
      </ul>

  <figure title="Twitter - Skip">
    <figcaption>The tutorial does allow you to skip to the real app&mdash;although it's very visually de-emphasized.</figcaption>

<p>I was planning on writing about how this applies to the first-run experience for users in Popcorn Maker/<a href="https://webmaker.org/en-US/">Webmaker</a>, but I'll have to expand on this later.</p>
